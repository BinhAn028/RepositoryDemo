# GitHub Copilot Commit Message Instructions

When generating commit messages, follow these rules:

- Use English for commit messages.
- The first line must always include the author's name: `BinhAn028`.
- The subject line (first line) should be no more than 50 characters.
- Use active voice and present tense verbs (e.g., "Add", "Fix").
- Avoid vague phrases like "update", "fix bug", or "change".
- Leave a blank line between subject and body.
- If the change needs explanation, provide detail in the body below the subject.

Example output:
BinhAn028: Add login validation for empty fields
